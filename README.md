## The Way of Generating Large-scale Training Data
Several Cloze-style reading comprehension datasets are readily available. Some general comparisons are given below.

| Dataset | Language | Genre | Blank<br />Type | Document | Query | Content |
| :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| CNN/Daily Mail<br/>(Hermann et al., 2015) | English | news | NE | news article | summary w/<br/>a blank | train+valid<br/>+test |
| Children's Book Test (CBTest)<br/>(Hill et al., 2015) | English | story | NE, CN,<br/> V, P | 20 consecutive<br/>sentences | 21th sentence w/<br/>a blank | train+valid<br/>+test |
| People Daily<br/>(Cui et al., 2016a) | Chinese | news | NE, CN | news article w/<br/> a blank | the sentence that<br/>blank belongs to | train+valid<br/>+test |

## Neural Architectures
In this section, the models will be compared with each other. As illustrated, the comment only represents my own views. Also note that, the evaluation **DO NOT** take the model performance into account, and it just shows the characteristics of the model itself.
> Rating will be in 1 ~ 5 stars, where 5★ means best, and 1★ means worst.<br/>
Take Kadlec et al., 2016 as an example, <br/>
in `Model efficiency`, I give a 5★, meaning the training speed is very fast;<br/>
in `Implementation complexity`, I give a 4★, meaning it is relatively easy to implement such a neural network;<br/>
in `Hyper-parameter`, I give a 4★, meaning there are fewer hyper-params that should be  defined by human. Note that, here the hyper-parameters are only indicating the params in neural network itself, not including such as layer dimension or something else.

## Training Details
Here, I will have a brief comparison on the training details of each model, and hopefully you will have a better concept in parameter tuning.

## Training Tips
I show several tips in training these neural network models, FYI.

1) Use adaptive learning algorithm, if you are not expertise in optimizing vanilla `SGD`. Use learning rate decay, even if you use adaptive learning algorithm, such as `ADAM`, `RmsProp` etc.

2) Reshuffle training data in every epoch (general tips)

3) Any neural network models that are based on AS Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016) should pay attention to the overfitting problem. Add `dropout` or `l2_regularization` to solve this problem. Also, it should be noted that using regularization will slow down the convergence speed.

4) Do not use big batch size. Typically, 32 is a good start. Note that, though bigger batch size lead to faster training, the convergence speed may not be also fast (general tips)

5) `GRU` typically shares the comparable performance with `LSTM`, so feel free to use either of them.

6) Use gradient clipping 5~10, when using `LSTM` or `GRU`. Gradient Exploding can sometimes happen, which is more dangerous than gradient vanishing!


## Leaderboard
In this part, I only show the results on CNN/Daily Mail and Children's book story Named Entity and Common Noun (short for CBT-NE and CBT-CN) datasets.
Only single model evaluation is showed here.
For more results, such as ensemble performance, please directly refer to the related papers.

The best result in each category is marked with bold face.
